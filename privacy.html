  <h1>Privacy Policy for Drive Link Exporter</h1>

  <p>Effective Date: October 2025</p>

  <p>
    Drive Link Exporter (“the Extension”) is a Chrome extension designed to help users
    export Google Drive file metadata (such as file names, IDs, and links) from folders they select.
    We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This policy explains what data we access,
    how we use it, and how it is protected.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data Accessed</h2>
  <p>
    The extension requests read-only access to Google Drive metadata through the scope:
    <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly</code>.
    The Extension never reads, downloads, or modifies file contents.
    It only accesses metadata such as file name, ID, MIME type, size, and webViewLink/webContentLink values
    for the files within the Google Drive folder you explicitly choose.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>
    The accessed metadata is used solely to generate a CSV file containing the file listing
    of the selected Google Drive folder. All processing occurs locally in your browser session.
    No data is transmitted to, stored on, or processed by any external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Drive Link Exporter does not share, sell, or disclose Google user data or metadata
    with any third party. The Extension does not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage & Protection</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension performs all operations in-memory on the client side.
    No Google user data is stored persistently by the Extension.
    OAuth tokens are securely handled by Google and Chrome according to standard Google authentication practices.
  </p>

  <!-- ✅ Added section to explicitly describe data protection mechanisms (Google reviewer expectation) -->
  <h2>5. Security Measures for Google User Data</h2>
  <p>
    We implement the following data protection mechanisms for Google user data accessed via the
    <code>drive.metadata.readonly</code> scope:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Local-only processing:</strong> Google Drive metadata is processed locally within the browser session.
      The Extension does not operate any backend servers or external processing services.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>No external storage:</strong> The Extension does not store Google Drive metadata on external servers
      or in persistent storage. Data is held in-memory only for the purpose of generating the CSV.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Secure authentication (OAuth 2.0):</strong> Access is granted only after the user completes Google’s
      OAuth 2.0 consent flow. Tokens are issued and managed using Google and Chrome’s standard authentication mechanisms.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Encrypted transport:</strong> Communication between the Extension (via the user’s browser) and Google APIs
      is protected by HTTPS/TLS encryption.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>No advertising, profiling, or AI/ML training:</strong> Google user data is not used for advertising,
      analytics profiling, marketing, or training machine learning models.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension does not store or retain any user data.
    Once the session ends or the browser popup is closed, all accessed data is cleared.
    Users may also revoke the Extension’s access anytime from their Google Account
    permissions page
    (<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>).
  </p>

  <h2>7. Compliance with Google API Services User Data Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Extension fully complies with the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      Google API Services User Data Policy
    </a>, including the Limited Use requirements. Google user data is used solely to provide the Extension’s
    core functionality (exporting Google Drive file metadata selected by the user into a CSV).
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>

    If you have questions about this policy or how the Extension handles your data,
